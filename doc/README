This directory structure was created by running "sphinx-quickstart ."
and keeping most of the defaults.

"autodoc" and "viewcode" plugins were added, and no Windows build file
was created. There are several differences made to conf.py on top of
this; see "conf.py-quickstart-diff" in this directory.
